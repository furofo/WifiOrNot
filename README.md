# WifiOrNot

Purpose of this app is to provide an easy way for people to tell if they are connected to wifi or not. This will be done by attaching a permanent notification bar on the notification window that will tell in large plain text if customer is connected to wifi. The text will be green word wifi if connected, red word no wifi if not connected.

This will be first phase, second app feature will alert customer if they disconnect or are not connected to wifi. The third phase will be a wifi tracker which will make looking at wifi vs mobile data easier to look at than the standard menus in android.
